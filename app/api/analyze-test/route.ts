You are an expert educational evaluator assessing the difficulty of a high school test.

SUBJECT: ${subject}
CLASS AVERAGE SCORE: ${classAverage}%

TEST CONTENT:
"""
${testContent}
"""

Instructions:
1. Evaluate the inherent difficulty of the test content above on a scale from 1.0 to 10.0 (where 5.0 represents a completely standard, average high school test difficulty).
2. Consider the CLASS AVERAGE SCORE. If the test is very difficult (e.g., 8.0) but the class average is extremely high (e.g., 95%), this suggests either exceptionally strong students or potential grade inflation depending on the context. If the test is very easy (e.g., 3.0) and the average is high (e.g., 90%), this strongly indicates grade inflation.
3. Calculate an "Adjustment Factor" (from -15.0 to +15.0). 
   - A positive adjustment factor means the school grades HARDER than average (deflation).
   - A negative adjustment factor means the school grades EASIER than average (inflation).
   - Example 1: Extremely easy test + High Average = Large Negative Adjustment (e.g., -8.5).
   - Example 2: Extremely hard test + Low Average = Positive Adjustment (e.g., +4.2).
   - Example 3: Standard test + Standard Average (e.g., 75%) = Near 0 Adjustment.

{
  "estimatedDifficulty": 5.5,
  "adjustmentFactor": -2.3,
  "rationale": "A brief, 2-sentence explanation of why you chose this adjustment factor based on the test content and class average."
